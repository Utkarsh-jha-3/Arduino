# I2C Protocols
### What are I2C Protocols?
**I2C** _(pronounced I square C)_ or **Inter-Integrated Circuit** is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like *microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces* and other similar peripherals in embedded systems. I2C bus is popular because it is simple to use, there can be more than one master, only upper bus speed is defined. The easy implementations comes with the fact that only two wires are required for communication between up to almost 128 (112) devices when using 7 bits addressing and up to almost 1024 (1008) devices when using 10 bits addressing. <br><br>

Each I2C slave device needs an address. Each slave device has a unique address. Transfer from and to master device is serial and it is split into 8-bit packets. All these simple requirements make it very simple to implement I2C interface even with cheap microcontrollers that have no special I2C hardware controller. You only need 2 free I/O pins and few simple i2C routines to send and receive commands.

#### I2C Interface
I2C uses only two wires, **SDA** (*serial data*) and **SCL** (*serial clock*). SCA has the purpose of producing a synchronic wave or the clock wave, whereas SDA is a digital wave containing data in form of bits.

#### I2C Address
I2C generally uses 8-bit data transmission. The first 7-bits are the address bits which contains the address of the slave devices, followed by the 8th-bit which indicates *read* or *write*. This forms the **Control Byte**.

#### I2C Protocols
The protocol begins with a *start signal* by the master device which is followed by the *Control Unit*. After every 9th clock cycle we either have an *Acknowledge (ACK)* bit or *Not Acknowledge (NACK)* bit. Further running depends on this. If the bit is ACK, the next 8-bits contain the data sent by the Master device which is again followed by ACK or NACK. When NACK is encountered, it is considered as an end sign.

#### Conclusion
I2C bus is used by many integrated circuits and is simple to implement. Any microcontroller can communicate with I2C devices even if it has no special I2C interface. I2C specifications are flexlible â€“ I2C bus can communicate with slow devices and can also use high speed modes to transfer large amounts of data. Because of many advantages, I2C bus will remain as one of the most popular serial interfaces to connect integrated circuits on the board.
### I2C and Arduino
First and foremost we need to connect the boards.The Serial Clock pin of the Arduino Board will be connected to the Serial Clock pins of the two breakout boards, the same goes for the Serial Data pins and we will *power the boards with the Gnd* and the *5V pin from the Arduino Board*. Note here we are not using pull-up resistors because the breakout boards already have them. However, if that is not the case, pull-up resistors can be used externally as well. Now in order to communicate with these chips or sensors we need to know their unique addresses. We can find them from the datasheets of the sensors .We can also get or check the addresses using the I2C Scanner sketch which can be found from the Arduino official website.<br><br>![I2C and Arduino](https://cdn.instructables.com/FW0/56GU/J8UH083V/FW056GUJ8UH083V.LARGE.jpg)<br><br>
### Source code
Here is an example where we use the GY-80 breakout board which consists 5 different sensors and the GY-521 breakout board which consists 3 different sensors.<br><br>
We will use the Arduino **Wire Library**. *The Wire.begin() function* will initiate the Wire library and also we need to initiate the serial communication because we will use the Serial Monitor to show the data from the sensor.
In the loop() we will start with the *Wire.beginTransmission() function* which will begin the transmission to the particular sensor, the 3 Axis Accelerometer in our case. Then with the *Wire.write() function* we will ask for the particular data from the two registers of the X axis. The *Wire.endTransmission()* will end the transmission and transmit the data from the registers. Now with the *Wire.requestFrom() function* we will request the transmitted data or the two bytes from the two registers. The *Wire.available() function* will return the number of bytes available for retrieval and if that number match with our requested bytes, in our case 2 bytes, using the Wire.read() function we will read the bytes from the two registers of the X axis. At the end we will print the data into the serial monitor.

#include <Wire.h>
int ADXLAddress = 0x53;  // Device address.
#define X_Axis_Register_DATAX0 0x32   // Hexadecima address for the DATAX0 internal register.
#define X_Axis_Register_DATAX1 0x33   // Hexadecima address for the DATAX1 internal register.
#define Power_Register 0x2D  // Power Control Register
int X0,X1,X_out;
void setup() {
  Wire.begin(); // Initiate the Wire library
  Serial.begin(9600);
  delay(100);
  // Enable measurement
  Wire.beginTransmission(ADXLAddress);
  Wire.write(Power_Register);
  // Bit D3 High for measuring enable (0000 1000)
  Wire.write(8);  
  Wire.endTransmission();
}
void loop() {
  Wire.beginTransmission(ADXLAddress); // Begin transmission to the Sensor 
  //Ask the particular registers for data
  Wire.write(X_Axis_Register_DATAX0);
  Wire.write(X_Axis_Register_DATAX1);
  
  Wire.endTransmission(); // Ends the transmission and transmits the data from the two registers
  
  Wire.requestFrom(ADXLAddress,2); // Request the transmitted two bytes from the two registers
  
  if(Wire.available()<=2) {  // 
    X0 = Wire.read(); // Reads the data from the register
    X1 = Wire.read();   
  }
  
  Serial.print("X0= ");
  Serial.print(X0);
  Serial.print("X1= ");
  Serial.println(X1);
}
